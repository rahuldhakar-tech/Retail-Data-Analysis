## üöÄ SQL Queries & Insights

### üìä Data Validation
- Verify data import: `SELECT * FROM sales_data;`
- Count total transactions: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_data;`
- Check for NULL values:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sales_data
  WHERE transactions_id IS NULL OR sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL
  OR customer_id IS NULL OR gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL
  OR quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL OR total_sales IS NULL;
  ```

### üîç Business Insights
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Category Performance Analysis**
- Top revenue-generating categories:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, SUM(total_sales) AS Total_revenue
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY category
  ORDER BY Total_revenue DESC;
  ```
- Total quantity sold per category:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY category
  ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
  ```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Behavior Analysis**
- Revenue contribution by gender:
  ```sql
  SELECT gender, COUNT(gender) AS Distribution_gender, SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue_by_gender
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY gender
  ORDER BY total_revenue_by_gender DESC;
  ```
- Age groups contributing the most revenue:
  ```sql
  SELECT age, SUM(total_sales) AS total_revenue
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY age
  ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
  ```

### üìà Aggregations & KPIs
- **Total sales revenue for January 2022:**
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_revenue_jan2022
  FROM sales_data
  WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2022 AND MONTH(sale_date) = 1;
  ```
- **Average price per unit:**
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(price_per_unit) AS avg_price_per_unit FROM sales_data;
  ```
- **Max quantity sold in a single transaction:**
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity_per_transaction FROM sales_data;
  ```
- **Unique customers count:**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers FROM sales_data;
  ```
- **Total cost of goods sold:**
  ```sql
  SELECT ROUND(SUM(cogs), 2) AS total_cogs FROM sales_data;
  ```

### üïí Date & Time Analysis
- **Total sales on weekends:**
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(total_sales) AS total_weekend_sales
  FROM sales_data
  WHERE DAYOFWEEK(sale_date) IN (1, 7);
  ```
- **Transactions before 12:00 PM:**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(transactions_id) AS transactions_before_noon
  FROM sales_data
  WHERE TIME(sale_time) < '12:00:00';
  ```
- **Most popular sales hour:**
  ```sql
  SELECT HOUR(sale_time) AS sale_hour, COUNT(*) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY sale_hour
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC
  LIMIT 1;
  ```
